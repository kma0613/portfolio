    <div class="row">
      <h5 class="block-header">Branding</h5>
      <p class="block-desc">
        I chose the name “Hatch” because this project focuses on people creating projects and allowing others to fund or “incubate” their projects. If successful, then their project/dream will hatch and become a reality. Additionally, people from different situations will be coming to Hatch to create projects, so I wanted to focus on creating a brand that was warm and supporting. With this idea in mind, I chose a typeface for the logo that felt welcoming and chose friendly, bright colors that would make users feel more positive and pepped up about their cause.

    <div class="row">
      <h5 class="block-header">User Flow</h5>
      <p class="block-desc">
        Hatch’s user flow focuses on four main functionalities: Project Discovery, Project Creation, User Accounts, and Support. Since Hatch encompasses a diverse user base that includes the technologically illiterate, ease of use was the main focus when creating the user flow. For example, a simple search/discover flow allows users to easily view and donate to projects. Project creation is broken down into three primary sections to eliminate confusion: project information, identity verification, and project deletion.

<div class="wireframes grid--center">
    <div class="row">
      <h5 class="block-header">Wireframes</h5>
      <p class="block-desc">
        When creating the wireframes for Hatch, ease of use still applied to the page layouts, particularly to project creation. Since a decent amount of information needs to be collected from a project creator, designing a consistent layout able to easily guide creators through the entire process was crucial. For project progress, displaying average donation collections through a graph reduced clutter and gave project creators a user-friendly, visual interpretation of important data.

      <h5 class="block-header">Final Mockups</h5>
      <p class="block-desc">
        When creating the final mockups for Hatch, it was initially a challenge for me to remove myself from the mobile design mindset. In order to overcome this obstacle, I focused on viewing the content from a developer’s standpoint. Having a clear picture of how each page would be created through HTML and CSS was crucial to my mockup designs. Working with a web app allowed me to realize that what matters is the content itself and spacing between each content element, since I cannot control the width and height of a user’s visible area.
